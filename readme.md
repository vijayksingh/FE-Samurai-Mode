### React

[Awesome List about all things React Components](https://github.com/component-driven/awesome-list)

Problem: After going through few courses in react i always keep running into situation where i was always confused about how to design `resiliant robust reusable` components. So one night i sit down and scanned through various places (hackernews, reddit, twitter, google search) to learn about designing component. 

These are the set of resources that i found to be suitable.
